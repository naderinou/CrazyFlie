# Nano

Nano is a *CrazyFlie 2* BLE-Unix based Python client.

It was developped by Nader GEORGI during his last year in the University of South Brittany during "INF2344 - Synthese dâ€™Images et Animation" course.

The project had two phases :
- Phase One :
  - Fly the CrazyFlie 2 directly from a unix pc (mac-OS, Linux).
  - Use Bluetooth Low Energie to control the drone instead of using the crazyradio dongle.


- Phase Two  :
  - Merge with the following projects :
         -  Emotiv Epoc+ : Fly the Crazyflie 2 using an Emptiv Epoc+.
         -  Data Glove : Fly the Crazyflie 2 using a Data Glove.



### Phase One
`completed`.

### Phase Two
-   DataGlove* : `completed`.
-   Emotiv Epoc+* : `completed`.

* need to install [python-socketio](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-socketio "python-socketio") to communicate with the nodJS server
