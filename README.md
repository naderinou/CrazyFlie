# Nano

Nano is a CrazyFlie 2 BLE-Unix based Python client.
It was developped by Nader GEORGI during his last year in the University of South Brittany during "INF2344 - Synthese dâ€™Images et Animation" course.

The project had two phases :
- Phase One :
  - Fly the CrazyFlie 2 directly from a unix pc (mac-OS, Linux).
  - Use Bluetooth Low Energie to control the drone instead of using the crazyradio dongle.


- Phase Two  :
  - Merge with the following projects :
         -  Emotiv Epoc+ : Fly the Crazyflie 2 using an Emptiv Epoc+
         -  Data Glove : Fly the Crazyflie 2 using a Data Glove

This text you see here is *actually* written in Markdown! To get a feel for Markdown's syntax, type some text into the left window and watch the results in the right.

### Phase One
`done`

### Phase Two
-   DataGlove : `done`
-   Emotiv Epoc+ : work in progress
